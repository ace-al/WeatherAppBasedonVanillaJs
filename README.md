Here's a functioning Weather App built with Vanilla JavaScript! Yeah right, no libraries (only) because the problem statement mandated so. The code isn't heavy on design and architecture cause the emphasis is on JavaScript. Plus I'm bad at Web Designing so HTML and CSS get the bare minimum treatment. But if you're someone who's reletively new to to JS and have been researching/googling to complete a project (like I was) and have by far realised that almost all the open source content, be it tutorials, forums, blogs on this topic use jQuery and you have to painstakingly build it yourself, this might help.

Now, I've used OpenWeatherMap API cause setting up an account with them is super easy and your free acount allows you to make 7200 api calls per day which isn't ideal for a high traffic site but works perfectly fine for me. For the semi interactive visualisations I used Charts.js.

Go through the code and see if you get it. I know you will. Still, if you've any questions feel free to mail me. I've submitted an exceptionally lame report (sorry, I tend to procrastinate) and that has been added to this repo. I should document this project soon enough. Goodluck, till then.
