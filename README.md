Here's a functioning Weather App built with Vanilla JavaScript! Yeah right, no libraries. I've used OpenWeatherMap API cause setting up an account with them is super easy and the free acount allows you to make 7200 API calls per day which isn't ideal for a high traffic site but works perfectly fine for you and I. For the semi interactive visualisations I used Charts.js.
